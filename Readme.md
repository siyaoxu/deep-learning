The repo includes course assignments and projects for my udacity deep learning nanodegree as well as my codes related to deep learning.

1. [A simple perceptron with numpy](https://github.com/siyaoxu/deep-learning/blob/master/my-neural-network.ipynb)
A one layer perceptron with numpy only and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

2. [Image classification with tensorflow](https://github.com/siyaoxu/deep-learning/blob/master/my-image-classifier/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb)
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 

3. [Word embedding](https://github.com/siyaoxu/deep-learning/blob/master/embeddings/Skip-Gram%20word2vec.ipynb)
Implement the word2vec algorithm using the skip-gram architecture.

4. [TV script generation](https://github.com/siyaoxu/deep-learning/blob/master/tv-script-generation/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)
Generate plausible Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs with part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons.

5. [language translation](https://github.com/siyaoxu/deep-learning/blob/master/language-translation/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb)
Train a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

6. [face generation](https://github.com/siyaoxu/deep-learning/blob/master/face_generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb)
Use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
